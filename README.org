  JSON encoder/decoder that processes a stream sequentially to reduce
  buffer memory requirements.

* Encoder

  Writes JSON sequentially to a stream. This avoids having to fill an
  encoding buffer before writing to the stream, allowing you to write
  JSON of almost any length without exceeding the memory capacity of
  small microprocessors.

  It is possible to write invalid JSON in this way, however, so some
  care needs to be taken that items are added in a meaningful order.
